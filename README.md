## Project: Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path in Brussels Metro

### Overview
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two metro stations in Brussels. The application is built using Java and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with the Repository pattern. The project utilizes Maven for dependency management and build automation, JUnit for unit testing, and JDBC to interact with an SQL database containing metro station information.

### Features
- Find the shortest path between two metro stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Retrieve metro station data from an SQL database via JDBC.
- Clear separation of concerns with MVC architecture and Repository pattern.
- Comprehensive unit tests using JUnit.

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6.3 or higher
- An SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with metro station data
- JDBC driver for your SQL database
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
